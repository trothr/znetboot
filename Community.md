IBM has an enormous library of freely available documentation.
The underlying z/VM environment is approachable described in:

    [Getting Started with z/VM for Linux](http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/hcsx0c31.pdf)

Which is IBM document  SC24-6194-06 (August 2017)

									<
In one of the discussion and community mailing lists, that work
was described by an IBM professional on one the mailing lists thus:

> One of the simplest is the Getting Started with z/VM for Linux manual
> that is part of the z/VM library.  It was intended as a basic fishing
> lesson, as opposed to just handing you fishing [tackle]

In IBM documentation identification, the last two digits indicate
the revision level of the document, here: -06 and was released,
not unexpectedly, in August 2017

Reading IBM documentation is fairly declared to be an acquired skill.
At one time, IBM was said to be the third largest publisher of originally
authored document in the US, behind the US Department of Defense,
and the Boy Scouts of America.  Not surprising, each of the three
is in the business of training people from wholly ignorant of a field,
to fully competent. Reading the (fine manual) documentation is to learn
from professionally designed, and maintained training materials.
That said, as the documentation cannot assay your particular level
of competence in an area, it has to have parts that you 'already know',
and may safely skip over

As hinted, there are several mailing lists to which one may freely
