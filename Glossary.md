# Glossary

Many terms used by maniframers are acronyms, assumed to be already
known and in the daily working language of end users.  For people coming to
the mainframe world, this can be quite confusing. This document serves as a
'Rosetta Stone' for translating mainframe-speak.

## Distributed

"Distributed Systems" is a term for non-mainframe stand-alone computers,
often derived from 'desktop' PC architectures:

* Intel and AMD x86, standard PC archiecture,
32-bit mode being largely obsolete but still commonly found in use

* Intel and AMD x86_64, 64-bit PC architecture, capable of running
32-bit mode x86 programs, most of which are also capable of running
virtualization programs (hypervisors), such as Xen, Libvirt,
and the proprietary VMWare

* Intel IA64 (Itanium II),
a 64-bit PC architecture, predecessor to x86_64,
which cannot run 32-bit x86 programs apart from emulation

## Other Distributed

Some non-PC and non-mainframe architectures include the following.

* P is the 'Power' RISC -- Reduced Instruction Set Computer --
architecture redesign. RISC represented a trend in the hardware
processing the instructions, to shrink the nunber of instruction
primitives which given semiconductor die or processor chipset needed to
implement, and so, to get a net increase of speed, reduction of power
needs, and so, more cost effective performance.

* SPARC (Scalable Processor Architecture)
is the RISC architecture from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle)

* PA-RISC (Precision Architecture - reduced instruction set computer)
is the RISC architecture from Hewlett Packard (now HPE)

* ARM (Advanced RISC Machine, originally Acorn RISC Machine)
is the RISC architecture developed by Arm Holdings

## Mainframe

"mainframe" is the informal term for IBM "Z" class architecture.
Other architectures include "I" and "P", which have mostly merged,
and "X" for PC class systems.

* Z is a succession of mostly backward conmpatible designs, originating
from the early System/360 instruction set (with that early subset of
implemented binary Machine Language instructions still supported, and
represented in a human-readible form in Basic Assembly Language LINK
and surrounding ecosystem of I/O Channel Co-Processor design
(similarly programmed in a CCP language).  An I/O co-processor is
designed to receive at high rate, commands and content data, and so to
permit off-loading by the central computation hardware
and RAM store to be able to hand off substantially all I/O tasks to
the proper 'CCP', and then to task switch to another ready-to-go
computational job in its 'runnable' job queue.

The switch in context permitted a processor to engage in multi-task
processing. This was used in release 360/VM to have a very early
(pre Unix) form of three seeming virtual, but seperate task processor
spaces (called BG, F1 and F2 -- the Background task, and Foreground 1
and 2 tasks) which was in use in the late 1960's, and has been extended
ever since.

## Glossary

* ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange;
see: EBCDIC, infra

* BAL: Basic Assembly Language

* BCD: Binary Coded Decimal -- a character set use by IBM on their 1401 series
predecessor (discrete transistors and plugboards based), proposed to
transition off of Hollerith 'tab' cards encoding a 12 rows,
called: A B, and 0 through 9

* CMS: officially the Conversational Monitor System,
a single user operating system packaged with z/VM
and used for the majority of housekeeping work in z/VM.
CMS provides the interactive environment which defines the user experience
when z/VM is employed as an operating system product.

* cURL: local convention, after the network file transfer utility; another
example might be 'wget'

* DASD: Direct Access Storage Device, i.e., "disk"

The majority of DASD for IBM Z systems allows traditional
track and record geometry as the more common fixed-block disk geometry.
Most other computer architectures use fixed-block geometry for all disk
types except floppies. Ironically, major DASD vendors provide
track and record geometry by emulation, using fixed-block devices
for the physical backing store.

* DCSS: Discontiguous Shared Segment; a memory segment
(commonly contiguous, despite the name) which can be shared across
virtual machines on z/VM. DCSS provides an effective sort-of virtual ROM
for z/VM virtual machines. A DCSS can contain a filesystem, and z/Linux
has drivers which take advantage of this.

* EBCDIC: Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code,
IBM's preferred character set for S/390 and AS/400 and successor to BCD.
EBCDIC is a character encoding conceptually similar to ASCII but with
different (and incompatible) character-to-bit-pattern assignments.
Translation between EBCDIC and ASCII is usually done transparently,
but some differences occasionally leak out.

* ECKD: Extended Count-Key-Data is a disk recording format which adds
counts and keys to track-and-record disk format. It is derived from CKD.

* EXEC: in CMS is the filetype for a scripted command. (think shell script)
CMS provides three interpreters, the preferred being REXX. To indicate
that an EXEC should be interpreted as REXX, the file must start with
a REXX comment and thus begin with slash asterisk /*.

* FOSS: Free and Open Source Software

* FLOSS: Free/Libre Open Source Software, a variant of FOSS
with essentially the same meaning.

* GPLv2: one of several licenses documented by the Free Software
Foundation, providing generaly that if one transfers a binary form of
software to someone, one must also make the sources and documentation of
the methods used to produce it, and to continue that license requirement
on the transferee to any later successor or sub-transferee.

* I/O: input/output, communucation outside of the given processor
chassis, as to a punch card reader (1402), line printer (1403), hard
drive (3390), console device (3270 or 3215), network connection (OSA)

* IFL: Integrated Facility for Linux; a ham-strung mainframe processor
which can boot Linux and can boot z/VM but cannot boot z/OS or other
operating systems. IFLs are priced lower than general purpose engines.

* IUCV: Inter-User Communication Vehicle; a service of z/VM
for communicating between virtual machines, so named because
a "user" on z/VM is a virtual machine and a virtual machine is a user.
IUCV is operationally much like named sockets,
which is process-to-process, but is VM-to-VM.

VM/CMS and z/Linux support AF_IUCV sockets.
On Linux, AF_IUCV is defined across all architectures
but is only effective when the architecture is Z and Linux is
hosted by z/VM.

* Linux: specifically, a computer core executive program developed
initially by Linus Torvalds, and as time passes a commuinity of developers,
some completely unpaid, others sponsored by an employer; It is copyrighted,
but freely available on terms of a license known as the GPLv2.  Generally a
shorthand way to refer to an ecosystem of libraries and programs which make
that core executive useful in performing general computing tasks

* LPAR: a Logical PARtition is a section of persistent storage (usually in
a hard disk like DASD) reserved for a perticular operating system instance.

* NSS: Named Saved System; related to DCSS, a kernel which can be
booted by name (rather than booted from a device by address).

* OSA-Express: Open Systems Adapter; a networking interconnect method
used by IBM hardware, and dynamically managable under software control,
rather than by setting up a physical Ethernet network of interfaces, patch
cables, and network switches.  It can perform similar ISO seven layer stack
functions, and operates at layers 2 and 3 of that stack.  WIthin a single
mainframe, it removes the potential for covert interception of network
traffic, as there is no point of attack available to a person lacking rights
to 'tap' into and 'tee' content off of (passively6 or via active 'spoofing')

* Rexx: a scripting language widely use by IBM products

* RISC: Reduced Instruction Set Computer

* SFS: Shared FileSystem; in CMS, SFS is a filesystem which can be used
by several virtual machines simultaneously. Historical CMS filesystems
reside on virtual disks which cannot be shared without side-channel
locking and related coordination.

* TCP/IP: one of several protocols for of data transfer between computing
devices (Mainframes, CCP devices, remote systems)

* Unit Record equipment; 'tab' card based computing; 026 keypunch, 029
key verified, 082 sorter, 5xx series plugboard and patch cable' programmed
relay based electronic computing devices; successor was the 1401 family and BCD

* X3270: a IP network console with a variant form of the 'telnet' type
of interface; As it dates from an earlier era, there are areas of the screen,
called 'fields' in which input mat be typed; the TAB key will advance to the
next available field (some fields may be 'display only') after the present
cursor position. ENTER customarily submits all of the 'fill-in' fields to
the remote server for processing as a transaction.  Until ENTER is selected,
one may cycle and wrap around through all editable fields, and either
over-type, or use minimal in-field edit commands

* wget: see: cURL

* XEDIT: the primary file editor in CMS

* z/VM: IBM's hypervisor product for mainframe (z series) architecture,
formerly known as VM/ESA, VM/XA, VM/SP and VM/HPO, VM/370, CP/67, CP/40.
